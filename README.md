# Sorting Algorithms
17/12/2017

A collection of some of the most commonly used sorting algorithms.

The purpose of this was to give me solid understanding of each sorting algorithm.

For each algorithm, I have written a few paragraphs which briefly explains how it works and also it's time complexity. Most lines of code is also commented to explain the inner workings of the algorithm.

## Algorithms Covered

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Shell Sort
7. Counting Sort
8. Radix Sort (WIP)
